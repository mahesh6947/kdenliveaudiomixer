 *
 * (From: http://techbase.kde.org/Projects/Widgets_and_Classes#KisCurveWidget)
 * KisCurveWidget allows editing of spline based y=f(x) curves. Handy for cases
 * where you want the user to control such things as tablet pressure
 * response, color transformations, acceleration by time, aeroplane lift
 *by angle of attack.
