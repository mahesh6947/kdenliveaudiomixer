/**
  \brief Abstract class for audio/colour scopes (receive data and paint it).

  This abstract widget is a proof that abstract things sometimes \b *are* useful.

  The widget expects three layers which
  \li Will be painted on top of each other on each update
  \li Are rendered in a separate thread so that the UI is not blocked
  \li Are rendered only if necessary (e.g., if a layer does not depend
    on input images, it will not be re-rendered for incoming frames)

  The layer order is as follows:
  \verbatim
     _____________________
    /                     \
   /      HUD Layer        \
  /                         \
  ---------------------------
     _____________________
    /                     \
   /     Scope Layer       \
  /                         \
  ---------------------------
     _____________________
    /                     \
   /   Background Layer    \
  /                         \
  ---------------------------
  \endverbatim

  Colors of Scope Widgets are defined in here (and thus don't need to be
  re-defined in the implementation of the widget's .ui file).

  The custom context menu already contains entries, like for enabling auto-
  refresh. It can certainly be extended in the implementation of the widget.

  If you intend to write an own widget inheriting from this one, please read
  the comments on the unimplemented methods carefully. They are not only here
  for optical amusement, but also contain important information.
